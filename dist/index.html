        <h1>Unfolding the Fourth Dimension:</h1>
        <h2>How to Render a Tesseract in 2D</h2>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>
          Using vanilla TypeScript and some basic math we can calculate how to
          render a four dimensional shape on a two dimensional plane.
        </p>
        <p>Below you can see a live version of the code running:</p>
      </section>

      <div style="background-color: #444">
        <canvas id="canvas" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
      </div>

      <section>
        <h2>1. Create a 4D Vector</h2>
        <p>
          For the first step we create a new class called "Vector4D" which holds
          the four numbers for x,y,z and the fourth dimension which we'll call w
          here, aswell as two properties called "planeX" and "planeY" which will
          represent the 2d coordinates of where the vector will be located on
          the plane.
        </p>

        <h3>1.1 Project the vector onto 2D</h3>
        <p>
          Using a really simple projection formula, we can calculate the planeX
          and planeY properties using the following formula:
        </p>
        <code>
          const dist = 2;<br />
          const w = 1 / (dist - this.w);<br />
          const projection3D = {<br />
          x: this.x * w,<br />
          y: this.y * w,<br />
          z: this.z * w<br />
          }<br />

          const w2 = 1 (dist - this.z);<br />
          this.planeX = projection3D.x * w2;<br />
          this.planeY = projection3D.y * w2;
        </code>

        <h3>1.2 Create rotation-methods</h3>
        <p>
          Next we add a method that rotates a vector by a given angle, to
          achieve this, we use calculate dot-product of a rotation-matrix and
          the vector points.
        </p>

        <p>
          The rotation matrix to rotate around the y-axis for example, looks
          like this:
        </p>
        <code>
          [cos(θ), 0, -sin(θ), 0]<br />
          [0,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          1,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0, 0]<br />
          [sin(θ), 0, &nbsp;cos(θ), 0]<br />
          [0,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          0,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0, 1]<br />
        </code>
        <p>Where θ is the angle in radians.</p>

        <p>
          Multiply the matrix with the coordinates of the vector and update them
          accordingly. Also call the projection method again, so the planeX and
          planeY will be updated aswell.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Create the vectors that make up the tesseract</h2>
        <p>
          A tesseract is made out of 16 vectors so we create a vector for each
          one. These are their coordinates:
        </p>
        <code>
          [-1, -1, -1, -1]<br />
          [1, -1, -1, -1]<br />
          [1, 1, -1, -1]<br />
          [-1, 1, -1, -1]<br />
          [-1, -1, 1, -1]<br />
          [1, -1, 1, -1]<br />
          [1, 1, 1, -1]<br />
          [-1, 1, 1, -1]<br />
          [-1, -1, -1, 1]<br />
          [1, -1, -1, 1]<br />
          [1, 1, -1, 1]<br />
          [-1, 1, -1, 1]<br />
          [-1, -1, 1, 1]<br />
          [1, -1, 1, 1]<br />
          [1, 1, 1, 1]<br />
          [-1, 1, 1, 1]<br />
        </code>
        <p>As you may have noticed, these are all the possible combinations.</p>

        <h2>Draw the vectors and rotate them at will</h2>
        <p>
          Now all we have to do is looping through all our vectors, getting
          their planeX and planeY and draw it to the canvas.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can now also call the rotate methods that multiply the coordinates
          of the vector with the rotation-matrix
